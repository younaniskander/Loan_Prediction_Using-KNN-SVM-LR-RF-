# Loan_Prediction_Using-KNN-SVM-LR-RF-
In this project, we aim to predict loan disbursement using various machine learning algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF). By utilizing these algorithms, we intend to analyze and compare their performances.

# Loan_Prediction_with pipeline
The process of predicting loans with pipelines involves using a series of sequential steps to preprocess the data before feeding it into the machine learning model. By creating a pipeline, the data is automatically transformed in each step without the need for manual intervention. This helps to streamline the entire loan prediction process and improve the accuracy of the model. With pipelines, loan prediction becomes a more confident and reliable process.
