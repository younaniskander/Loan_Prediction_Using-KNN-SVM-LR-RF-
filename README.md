# Loan_Prediction_Using-KNN-SVM-LR-RF-
In this project, we aim to predict loan disbursement using various machine learning algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF). By utilizing these algorithms, we intend to analyze and compare their performances. .
